                GREAT OAKS GROW FROM ACORNS SMALL
            </h1>
            <p>
                Educating and discipling children is a high calling, but it is not for those who want immediate results. Teaching and training our children requires a long-term vision and the tenacity with which to carry out that vision. It’s not for the weak-kneed or faint at heart. If ever we need parents willing to plant the seeds for the next generation it is now. Planting is hard work. If you have ever had a garden, think back over your labors. The heat, the bugs, the weeds, the back-breaking work…it’s a job that one must tend consistently and without immediate fruit.  Yet, oh how wonderful the harvest!  There is a long-told story about an old, beautiful church.  After hundreds of years, the pillars began to rot.  As the elders discussed the remedy, the oldest member motioned them to come to the back. He pointed across the field behind the church where grew some of the largest, most impressive oak trees the eyes have ever seen.  When the founders of this church built it, they knew that in time, long after they were gone, the pillars would need to be replaced, and could not be replaced with just anything. So they planted those trees there for that purpose.  Now that’s vision!  We need to be the ones who plant the acorn seeds that will become the mighty oaks we may never live to see! Not only are we called to pass on a spiritual legacy to our children, but the Bible also speaks of passing on the faith to our children’s children. We must raise our children in such a way that their faith grows roots far into the next generation.  It takes deliberate life-work to do that!  No, it isn’t done apart from God’s grace and divine order. But it also isn’t done by a flippant attitude that takes advantage of that grace. We must speak of Him, live for Him, be willing to die for Him and pass that fervent love on to our children.  Most of us want results now.  We want instant trees. But God in his infinite wisdom has a better plan.  Sometimes His purposes through someone or some group of people can’t even be realized until long after they’re gone.  He takes our tiny acts of faithful obedience and multiplies it beyond what we can even comprehend. This is why faith in the unseen is SO important to Christians!  Will members of the next generation be able to see the diligence of the “planters” in this one?  We cannot be weary in well-doing! There’s a forest depending on our faithfulness. The seeds we plant should bear fruit for generation after generation. Only He can see the big picture; we need only trust His sovereignty and keep planting, hoeing and cultivating our trees!
