                    <p>
                        Statement of Faith:<br />We ask all families to read and signify that they agree with our statement of faith. This can be found on our website under the "About" link.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Attendance:<br />We meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from about 9-2pm.  Exact start and end times may vary based on your student’s age and from year to year.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        We ask our families to commit to prioritizing academy days and attend if at all possible.  We ask members to provide plenty of notice when they need to miss due to travel.  Absences due to sickness are inevitable, but Pillar and Oak has a substitute system that has allowed us to not miss for sickness this year.  Our policy for snow days is to cancel if Carthage schools cancel.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Calendar:<br />Our year is broken into 3 11-week terms.  We don’t have the calendar completely set yet, but we will be starting mid-August and ending by early May with a Christmas break for most of December.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Teacher Training:<br />Quarterly teacher training opportunities will be offered and required for all teachers or those wanting to be considered for a lead teacher role.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Mother Culture:<br />As a group, we will be reading either Charlotte Mason’s volumes or another book on the philosophy and meeting monthly to discuss.  These meetings are not strictly required, but are greatly encouraged.  They are required for all teachers or if a mom wants to be considered for a teacher role. This meeting is the 4th Thursday of the month.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Nature Group:<br />Being outside and learning from nature is an essential part of Charlotte Mason’s philosophy.  We organize a weekly Nature Group for all families of Pillar and Oak Academy, but they are not required.  We do highly encourage spending time outside on family walks.  Nature Group is something other families who are not participating in the academy can join by applying this spring.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Family Events:<br />We have monthly events that the whole family is welcome to attend.  We want to create a community where all families are on board and participating in the growth and learning of their students.  The events range from Summer Book Club to Winter Handicraft Market to Spring camping, as well as our End of Term Recitals.  All these events are optional.
                    </p>

                        Time Expectations<br />Pillar & Oak is classified as a homeschool cooperative.  Each family is responsible for keeping track of students' hours, grades and work.  However, unlike many other cooperatives, we meet 2 days a week to cover the majority of the students' required subjects through our curriculum.   Moms (or Dads) will spend the day helping in each of their students' classes and should prepare accordingly. You can find a sample of our schedules below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dress Code:<br />When we gather for academy days, we follow the following dress code.  We see this as a way to distinguish days for learning from any other days.  We also find that this gives our students a sense of unity and purpose with their peers.
                    </p>
