                </h3>
                <p>
                    The first branch of Pillar & Oak is our Academy.  We meet Tuesdays and Thursdays for our Academy days each week.  In order to maintain a high level of excellence, enrollment is limited and dependent on the ratio of highly qualified teachers and current students.  An application process will precede enrollment. All those who participate will get to experience the richness of learning and growing in community with fellow like-minded families, as well as all teacher training opportunities.

                <p>
                    The second branch of Pillar & Oak is our Friday morning Nature Group.  This is a rich and delightful time spent studying and enjoying nature with friends. Open enrollment for Nature Group will run April thru August.  All families participating in Academy are automatically welcome to join our Nature Group days.  This branch is also the perfect opportunity to be involved with our community without needing to commit to the full two-day Academy. Families with preschoolers are especially encouraged to join us for these fun outings!

                    The third branch of Pillar & Oak is our teacher training program which includes quarterly training opportunities for both mother-teachers and father-teachers.  We also offer fellowship and teacher training opportunities for both mothers and fathers monthly.  In addition, we provide a plethora of articles, videos, and other resources to help families feel equipped, encouraged, and supported in their homeschooling journey.  Once a family has applied to Pillar & Oak Academy or Pillar & Oak Nature Group, they will be given more information regarding teacher training opportunities!
