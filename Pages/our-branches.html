                        The first branch of Pillar & Oak is our Academy. We meet Tuesdays and Thursdays for Academy days each week. In order to maintain a high level of excellence, enrollment is limited and dependent on the ratio of highly qualified teachers and current students. We are intentionally collaborative, and at least one parent is asked to be on campus, and volunteer in a teaching or assistant position. An application process will precede enrollment. Currently our enrollment is closed. You are welcome to fill out an application to be put on our wait list.

                        The second branch of Pillar & Oak is our Friday morning Nature Group. This is a rich and delightful time spent studying and enjoying nature with friends. All families participating in Academy are welcome to join our Nature Group days. Visitors are always welcome, and need only fill out the waiver found here on the website prior to participation. This branch is the perfect opportunity to be involved with our community without needing to commit to the full two-day Academy. Families with preschoolers are especially encouraged to join us for these fun outings!

                        The third branch of Pillar & Oak is our Parent-Teacher Formation program which includes opportunities for both mother-teachers and father-teachers. We offer monthly Mother Culture meet-ups. In addition, we provide a plethora of articles, videos, and other resources to help families feel equipped, encouraged, and supported in their homeschooling journey.
