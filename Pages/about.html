                    DISTINCTLY CHRISTIAN
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A personal relationship with Jesus Christ, a belief in the authority and relevance of the Bible, and a desire to fulfill the Great Commission unites our community.  Psalm 24 says, “The Earth is the Lord’s and everything in it.”  We believe all of life, human investigation, and all subjects of learning fall under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  There should be no separation between sacred and secular.  All truth is God’s truth.  Beauty and goodness come from Him alone.  The Bible tells us that all treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ.  Solomon tells us, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.”  A distinctly Christian education then, integrates each subject into a coherent and totalizing Christian worldview. At Pillar & Oak, we emphasize this connection in every subject and area of study.

                <h3>
                    UNIQUELY CLASSICAL
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We believe the classical tradition to be one long conversation in the direction of virtue and wisdom.  Inquiry, ideas, and character along with a lively pursuit of truth drives our philosophy of education. We believe a classical education cultivates wisdom and virtue by developing affections for what is good, true, and beautiful. Far more than a utilitarian acquisition of basic skills, we wish to give every student a rich feast of all the best knowledge the world has to offer:  a <em>liberal</em> or generous education.

                <p>
                    A World-class Charlotte Mason curriculum informs our instruction. We utilize the Charlotte Mason Institute’s Alveary Curriculum, and yet tailor each subject taught to the vision of Pillar & Oak Academy as well as the educational needs of our current students.  We aim to provide a robust education filled with rich literature, life experiences, nature study, and beautiful ideas.

                <p>
                    A desire to partner with parents in their God-given role as primary educators is one of our main motivations for starting this Academy.  Support, encouragement, and teacher training opportunities for both mother-teachers and father-teachers abound in this community.
